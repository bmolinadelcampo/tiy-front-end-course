## Things I've learnt today about Markdown: 

* A fancy way of writing lists

* To write words in **bold** and *italic*

* I've being doing some research and there's no way of changing font colour

1. You can also write ordered lists like this

	* And even have sublists

	* Adding images is a bit more complicated:

	*You can also write quotes

	> Eeeeee... Va! 

2. This is my first table 

Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3
---------|----------|---------
blah blah | blah blah blah | blah 
la la | la la la | la la la la

3. I can mention someone just like this
@mdelamata and say Hello! 

4. Best thing of all: emoji is supported! 🤓😍🐷
